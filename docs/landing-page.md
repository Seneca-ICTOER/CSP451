### Part Three - Scalable, Portable, Resilient Design Patterns

<!-- <img src="../images/docker_icon.png" width="200"> -->

This part focuses on the design and deployment of a crafted network topology engineered to deliver reliable performance, scalability, and resilience. Leveraging Azure's Virtual Network (VNet) capabilities, you'll delineate secure and isolated network segments, meticulously tailored to meet the unique needs of diverse workloads. Key topics covered in this part are:

Efficient Resource Utilization: Kubernetes allows for efficient resource utilization in serverless designs by automatically scaling resources up or down based on demand. This ensures that only the necessary resources are allocated at any given time, optimizing cost and performance.
Container Orchestration: Kubernetes excels at container orchestration, enabling the deployment and management of serverless functions packaged as containers. With Kubernetes, serverless workloads can be easily scaled, managed, and monitored across clusters of machines.
Event-Driven Architecture: Serverless designs using Kubernetes can leverage event-driven architecture, where functions are triggered in response to events such as HTTP requests, messages from queues, or changes in data stores. Kubernetes supports various event sources and can efficiently route events to the appropriate serverless functions.
Automatic Scaling: Kubernetes provides built-in autoscaling capabilities that dynamically adjust the number of serverless function instances based on workload demand. This ensures that applications can handle varying levels of traffic efficiently without manual intervention.
Fault Tolerance and Resilience: Kubernetes offers robust fault tolerance and resilience features, ensuring that serverless functions remain highly available even in the event of failures or disruptions. Features such as automatic container restarts, rolling updates, and self-healing mechanisms contribute to the overall reliability of serverless deployments.
Developer Productivity: By abstracting away infrastructure management complexities, Kubernetes enables developers to focus on writing code and building features rather than worrying about server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance. This enhances developer productivity and accelerates time-to-market for serverless applications.
Portability and Flexibility: Kubernetes provides a consistent platform for deploying serverless functions across on-premises data centers, public clouds, and hybrid environments. This portability ensures that serverless applications can run anywhere Kubernetes is deployed, offering flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.
Integration with Ecosystem Tools: Kubernetes integrates seamlessly with a wide range of ecosystem tools and services, including monitoring and logging solutions, CI/CD pipelines, service meshes, and API gateways. This enables comprehensive observability, automation, and management of serverless workloads within Kubernetes environments.

## What You Need to Know!

<!-- <img src="../images/wynk_icon.jpg" width="200"> -->

This is a project-based course that is designed to prepare you for your future careers by offering a dynamic and immersive learning experience. This course provides you with opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge gained throughout your academic journey to real-world scenarios, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. By working on authentic projects, you gain hands-on experience in navigating complexities, collaborating with other students to solve problems, and managing project timelines—skills highly sought after by employers in various industries. 

This course does not follow the regimented course-work addendum where you are frequently tested by quizzes, tests and exams, instead, you will be assigned challenging assignments that you need to research, analyze, and complete often requiring innovative solutions to unforeseeable challenges, thus enhancing your ability to adapt to the dynamics of the continuously evolving cloud computing industry. You will learn to stay abreast of emerging trends. The culmination of project-based assignments, throughout the course, will ultimately equip you with the confidence, competence, and practical expertise necessary to excel in your chosen career paths beyond the classroom.

There are no **formal teaching** sessions in this course. You are expected to explore and learn by completing assignments and coursework. During tutorials and classes, you will receive some hands-on examples of the challenging topics, however, be prepared to address the challenges yourself. You will be expected to complete most of the work individually, but at times for more complex projects you might be asked to work in a team, so be prepared to collaborate with your fellow students. 

## Who should **NOT** take this course?

<!-- <img src="../images/not_icon.jpg" width="200"> -->

If you are ready to take on the challenges of real-world projects, it may be advisable for you not to enroll in this course. Real-world projects demand a high level of commitment, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work effectively under pressure. Without these essential attributes, you may struggle to meet the course requirements and derive meaningful learning outcomes.

Moreover, participating in a course with project-based assignments requires you to actively engage in hands-on activities, collaborate with peers, and demonstrate initiative in tackling complex tasks. If you feel unprepared or lack the necessary skills and mindset to thrive in such an environment, it might be more beneficial for them to focus on building foundational knowledge and practical skills through prerequisite courses or additional training before attempting a course with real-world project components. Ultimately, taking on challenges beyond one's current capabilities can lead to frustration and may impede overall academic and personal development. Therefore, it's important for students to assess their readiness and choose courses that align with their current skill level and learning objectives.
